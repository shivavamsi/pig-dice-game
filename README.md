## Description
This web application allows two players to play a game of Pig Dice.

### Gameplay
* _Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls two dice, until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold"_
* _If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends._
* _If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends._
* _If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total._
* _If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues._
* _If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn._
